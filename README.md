Streaming Regex
=====
NOTE: this is WIP, and does not yet actually work as advertised below.

This is a fork of of the [Regex crate](https://crates.io/crates/regex), adding support for running regex's on non-contiguous or streaming data.

Note that this crate is slower than the regex crate, so you should use the regex crate if you are always running on contiguous data.
