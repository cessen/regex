exec.rs:
	- Exec / ExecNoSync: the types the implement a regex with maintained state during
	  an execution.  They allow input to be fed incrementally, consuming only as much
	  of the input as is needed for the next match.  We want to change these to take
	  sequential chunks of bytes at a time, rather than the same chunk with a `start`
	  offset over and over.

re_trait.rs:
	- RegularExpression: trait that describes the incremental functionality of
	  Exec / ExecNoSync.  This needs to be changed to work with sequential chunks
	  of bytes as well.
